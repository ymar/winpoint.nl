              B2B purchase decisions take 6-18 months. During that time, buying committees 
              research, compare, and debate. They talk to colleagues. They build business cases. 
              They get approval from procurement.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              But when they're finally ready to buy, who do they call?

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Not the company that went quiet after the first demo.</strong> Not the vendor whose sales 
              rep disappeared for three months. They call whoever stayed visible and helpful 
              throughout their entire buying journey.

              Sound familiar? You're not alone. Most B2B companies lose <strong>79% of qualified leads</strong>
