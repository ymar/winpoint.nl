# Re-engagement Scripts

## Introduction

Re-engaging with stalled prospects requires finesse. Generic "checking in" emails get ignored, but value-driven communications that address specific business challenges can reopen conversations and revive opportunities.

This collection provides **12 proven script templates** for different re-engagement scenarios, each designed to provide immediate value while gauging continued interest.

## General Principles

### Before You Write
1. **Research their current situation** - Check for company news, personnel changes, industry developments
2. **Identify the stall reason** - Timing, budget, internal politics, or competitive pressure?
3. **Choose your value angle** - What insight, resource, or opportunity can you share?
4. **Time it strategically** - Align with business cycles, industry events, or personal schedules

### Email Structure That Works
- **Subject line**: Specific and benefit-focused
- **Opening**: Brief personal connection or relevant insight
- **Value**: Share something useful (not a sales pitch)
- **Soft ask**: Low-pressure way to gauge interest
- **Easy out**: Clear way to say "not interested"

## Script Categories

## Follow-up Sequences

- **Month 3**: Final "checking in" message with easy out

### If They Say "Not Now"
- **Immediate**: Thank them and ask about timing

## Success Metrics

### Response Rates to Track

✅ "New development that affects [their specific challenge]"

### The Product Pitch
❌ "We've got a great solution for your needs"
✅ "Seeing interesting patterns with companies facing similar challenges"

### The Assumption Close
❌ "When would be a good time to move forward?"
✅ "Worth exploring if this approach fits your situation?"

### The Desperate Follow-up
❌ Multiple emails in short succession
✅ Spaced, value-driven communications
