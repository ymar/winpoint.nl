# Deal Recovery Playbook

## Introduction

Most sales teams write off deals too early. The reality is that **70% of "lost" deals are still recoverable** if you approach them systematically.

This playbook will teach you:
- How to identify truly recoverable opportunities
- The psychology behind deal stalls and losses
- Proven frameworks for re-engagement
- Timing strategies that actually work

## Chapter 1: The Recovery Mindset

### Why Most Recovery Attempts Fail

The biggest mistake sales teams make is treating deal recovery like a Hail Mary. They send generic "checking in" emails or make desperate phone calls.

**Real recovery requires:**
- Understanding the specific reason each deal stalled
- Timing your re-engagement correctly
- Addressing the actual blocker, not symptoms
- Having a systematic approach

### The 4 Types of "Lost" Deals

Not all lost deals are created equal. Understanding which type you're dealing with determines your recovery strategy:

#### 1. Timing Issues (40% of losses)
- Budget cycles don't align
- Internal priorities shifted
- Wrong time in buying process

#### 2. Value Disconnect (30% of losses)
- ROI not clearly demonstrated
- Solution doesn't match pain points
- Competitive alternative chosen

#### 3. Internal Politics (20% of losses)
- Decision maker changed
- Internal champion lost influence
- Organizational restructuring

#### 4. True Dead Ends (10% of losses)
- Company went out of business
- Project cancelled permanently
- Complete budget elimination

> **Key Insight**: Only 10% of deals are truly unrecoverable. The other 90% can be saved with the right approach.

## Chapter 2: The Recovery Framework

### Step 1: Deal Audit

Before any recovery attempt, conduct a thorough audit:

1. **Timeline Analysis**
   - When did momentum slow?
   - What was the last meaningful interaction?
   - What changed in their business?

2. **Stakeholder Mapping**
   - Who was involved in the original decision?
   - Have there been personnel changes?
   - Who might be new influencers?

3. **Competitive Landscape**
   - What alternatives are they considering?
   - What advantages do competitors have?
   - How can you differentiate?

### Step 2: Research & Intelligence

Before reaching out, gather current intelligence:

- **Company Updates**: Check news, press releases, job postings
- **Personnel Changes**: Use LinkedIn to track role changes
- **Financial Health**: Review quarterly reports if public
- **Industry Trends**: Understand market pressures they face

### Step 3: Craft Your Re-engagement Strategy

Choose your approach based on the deal type:

#### For Timing Issues:
- **Subject**: "Market changes affecting [specific initiative]?"
- **Approach**: Share relevant industry insights
- **Timing**: Quarterly check-ins aligned with business cycles

#### For Value Disconnect:
- **Subject**: "New case study: [similar company] results"
- **Approach**: Provide proof points and social proof
- **Timing**: When you have new relevant success stories

#### For Internal Politics:
- **Subject**: "Exploring options for [business outcome]"
- **Approach**: Reconnect with multiple stakeholders
- **Timing**: After suspected organizational changes settle

## Chapter 3: Re-engagement Tactics

### The "Insight" Email

Instead of "checking in," lead with value:

```
Subject: Manufacturing costs up 15% - automation impact?

Hi [Name],

Saw the industry report showing manufacturing costs jumped 15% this quarter. Given [Company]'s focus on operational efficiency, curious how this is affecting your automation timeline.

We just helped [Similar Company] reduce costs by 23% in this environment - happy to share what worked if useful.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### The "New Development" Approach

Share genuinely relevant updates:

```
Subject: Update on [previous discussion topic]

Hi [Name],

Remember our discussion about [specific challenge]? We just released an update that directly addresses the concern you raised about [specific issue].

Quick 15-minute demo available if you'd like to see how it works.

[Your name]
```

### The Multi-threaded Approach

Re-engage multiple stakeholders simultaneously with personalized messages.

## Chapter 4: Timing Your Recovery

### The 30-60-90 Rule

- **30 days**: Send insights and value-adds
- **60 days**: Share relevant case studies or updates  
- **90 days**: Make a soft re-engagement attempt
- **180 days**: Major new developments or personnel changes

### Seasonal Considerations

- **Q4**: Budget planning conversations
- **Q1**: New initiative launches
- **Q2**: Mid-year reviews and adjustments
- **Q3**: Preparation for next year planning

## Chapter 5: Measuring Recovery Success

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Response Rate**: % of re-engagement attempts that get replies
2. **Meeting Rate**: % that result in scheduled conversations
3. **Revival Rate**: % that return to active pipeline
4. **Recovery Revenue**: Total value of recovered deals

### Success Benchmarks

- **Good**: 15% response rate, 5% revival rate
- **Excellent**: 25% response rate, 10% revival rate
- **World-class**: 35% response rate, 15% revival rate

- [ ] Schedule follow-up sequences

### Week 4: Expand & Optimize

## Advanced Strategies

### The "Trojan Horse" Method

Re-engage around a different, smaller initiative to rebuild trust and access.

### The "Competitive Intel" Approach

Share insights about competitors or market changes that affect their decision.

### The "Executive Alignment" Strategy

Connect with higher-level executives around strategic business outcomes.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too aggressive**: Recovery requires patience
2. **Generic messaging**: Every re-engagement must be personalized
3. **Ignoring the reason**: Address why the deal stalled originally
4. **Single-threading**: Always have multiple contact points
5. **Poor timing**: Respect their business cycles and priorities

## Conclusion

Deal recovery isn't about being pushy or persistent. It's about being strategic, patient, and value-focused. Most "lost" deals are just deals waiting for the right approach at the right time.

Start with your highest-value opportunities and work systematically through the framework. With consistent application, you should see 10-15% of your lost deals return to active status within 6 months.
